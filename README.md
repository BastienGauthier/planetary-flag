# The Planetary Flag
This repository aims to create a planetary flag, based on the planetary boundaries therorized by Johan Rockstr√∂m et al in 2009, and increasingly developed afterwards. The format used is inspired by the Warming Stripes from Ed Hawkings, because of the interpretability of those, even outside of the scientist community.

A graphic version of the flag from 1850 to 2021 can be found herebelow:
